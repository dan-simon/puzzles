    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <h4>Unlocks</h4>
    <span>You start with 3 puzzles unlocked. After 3 hours, and every 6 hours thereafter, you unlock another puzzle. Solving a normal puzzle unlocks another puzzle (so it's equivalent to waiting 6 hours). Solving a metapuzzle acts like half of a puzzle unlock (so it's equivalent to waiting 3 hours).</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Metapuzzles unlock differently. They unlock once you have both unlocked all the puzzles going into the metapuzzle and solved at least all but 2 of those puzzles. (Since metapuzzles unlock differently, they're only counted as half of a puzzle unlock as described above to avoid too many puzzles being open at once too quickly.)</span>

    <h4>Guesses</h4>
    <span>Once you unlock a puzzle, you have 5 guesses on it. Guessing an answer uses a guess. You get another guess every 30 minutes. If you don't have any guesses on a puzzle, you need to wait to guess an answer to it until you get another guess.</span>
    <br/>
    <span>Guesses are per-puzzle; there's no way to transfer guesses on one puzzle to another. Metapuzzle guesses work just like regular puzzle guesses.</span>
