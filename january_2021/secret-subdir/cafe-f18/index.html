  <span>Hi! I'm in another universe, and I'm having a problem I'd like help with. Somehow the IC reverted back to its previous state, probably because of handwavy contracting work. Fortunately this doesn't seem to be due to any contamination that might destroy the universe or something (in fact, one analysis of the problem is that the IC is now its own universe), but it's still a problem.</span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <span>The only silver lining to this is that the IC's cafe is back open, though it's changed its name slightly and its offerings a lot. As usual, though, it's hugely understaffed (even though customers keep coming in asking for things) and it could use some help in keeping it open, even just for 40:00. You can't mess it up that much so figure it out as you go. Maybe when you finish, you'll figure out a way to fix the problem with the IC, too.</span>

  <span>[Massive list of explanation and caveats which I suggest reading but which is not itself a puzzle: This is a puzzle/programming exercise. If you don't like programming, you probably won't find this fun. I expect that, for maximum fun per person, the best numbers of people to solve with are one, two, or maybe three (so having a dozen people working on it is probably too many). Looking at the Javascript source is <i><b>not</b></i> intended; please don't look at it if you want the intended solving experience. This puzzle doesn't store anything locally and is entirely in your browser (which is part of the reason multi-person solving is less fun), so closing or refreshing the window will reset it.</span>

  <br/>
  <span>Depending on where you're coming from, you may have no idea how to answer any Cafe F18 questions initially. If so, I would suggest trial and error and not trying to do online research; there should be enough data given in the puzzle to use trial and error to figure out how to answer questions correctly. If you can't figure out what the above text about another universe and so on means, don't worry! That text barely helps and you can easily solve the puzzle without it.</span>

  <span>Just as a warning, this puzzle will play sound but this sound is not important to the puzzle; you can not listen to it without missing anything. <a href="rules.html" target="_blank">Here</a> are the rules of this puzzle in detail.]</span>
