    <h2>June 2017 Puzzles</h2>
    <p>Here are the <a href="puzzles.txt">puzzles</a> and <a href="solutions.txt">solutions</a>. Both are somewhat low-quality (the puzzles because I was even worse at making puzzles a few years ago than I am now, the solutions because they were written very quickly two and a half years later, just to have solutions). Also, these puzzles have no answer checker.</p>
