    <h2>Rules and Links</h2>
    <p>To solve "legitimately", don't look at the answer checker or anything with solutions in its filename or in any subdirectory titled solutions. Looking at HTML/CSS/JS files or at data from the GitHub repository is allowed but not required or even that helpful except for puzzles that clearly says otherwise, as long as you avoid the files mentioned in the first sentence. Each set of puzzles linked below is independent of the others. The answer checker takes a second (it may be slower or faster depending on your computer) make it slightly harder to use its code to get the answer by brute force.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the puzzles aren't testsolved. You can contact me (to report errors or puzzles that are too hard or too easy, to give feedback, to ask for hints, to express interest in testsolving future puzzles I write, or for any other reason) by creating an issue on the GitHub or by emailing [X, where X is the fourth letter of the alphabet][2.718281828...][letter that's doubled in "mess"][6 factorial times 2/3, should be 3 digits]@[⠝][− · − −][Y, where Y is the letter whose name sounds like the English second-person pronoun].[vowel in "ten"][X as previously defined][Y as previously defined] (this is intended to be nontrivial because I'm worried about automated email-finders getting more sophisticated). I very much appreciate any feedback, but especially feedback about the puzzles since then I can write better ones in the future.</p>
    <p>This probably goes without saying but given the current time of year it might not: this has nothing to do with any other puzzlehunts (unless some other puzzlehunt decides to incorperate it for some un-understandable reason).</p>
    <p>The GitHub is <a href="https://github.com/dan-simon/puzzles">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Links to all the puzzles I've put here (so far just one pile of terribleness made years ago and one meta, but that might change) are below. The intended difficulty is roughly easiest Mystery Hunt/Galactic Puzzle Hunt, or slightly above hardest Puzzled Pint, but that might change. Due to my skills, there's less trivia and more math and programming than in most puzzles.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="june_2017/index.html">June 2017 (one meta, this meta is terrible and none of the above applies to it, I briefly wrote solutions years later but they could be incorrect or missing something)</a></li>
      <li><a href="january_2020/index.html">January 2020 (one meta)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Updates and Errata</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>January 31: A link to an audio file in Leftovers, one of the January 2020 puzzles, was broken. This was not an intended part of the puzzle. The link has now been fixed.</li>
      <li>January 31: Hints have been added to the January 2020 puzzle page. Feel free to use them if you get stuck.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that errata in solutions are linked on the solutions pages, to avoid spoilers.</p>
