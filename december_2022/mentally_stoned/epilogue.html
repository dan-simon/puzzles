    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <span><a href="../mentally_stoned.html">[Back]</a> <span id="stars" class="star"></span></span>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <span>You start using your <span class="star">9 stars</span> to return to your universe. As you're about to leave with all the elves, you quickly record some data about this universe so that you can find it again; it wasn't actually that bad, and maybe you'll want to return at some point.</span>

    <span class="aside">Congratulations for finishing this puzzle! I couldn't/wouldn't have made this puzzle without Eric Wastl making <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a> every year (which I took a great deal of CSS from), Galactic Trendsetters making <a href="https://puzzles.mit.edu/2021/" target="_blank">MIT Mystery Hunt 2021</a>, betaveros making <a href="https://github.com/betaveros/noulith" target="_blank">Noulith</a>, and someone (I'm not sure if fully publicly, hence their not being credited) making an Advent-of-Code-inspired puzzle somewhat similar to this one.</span>
