    <h2>December 2022 Puzzle Notes</h2>
    <span>Firstly, this page is not a puzzle. Additionally, looking at source code will generally spoil puzzles, so it's suggested not to do it. Autocomplete in the JS console may also accidentally spoil stuff, so it's suggested not to open the console either. You can solve all puzzles without looking at source code or opening the console, though writing your own code is definitely helpful for some puzzles, and in some cases downloading images may be helpful (and it's safe spoiler-wise).</span>

    <span>This puzzle set was written vaguely contemporaneously with a puzzle-writing event. It leans a lot towards my puzzle type preferences. The puzzle difficulty per puzzle is probably, on average, comparable with Huntinality or Silph Puzzle Hunt puzzles, or on the easier side of Galactic Puzzle Hunt, Teammate Hunt, or Mystery Hunt puzzles.</span>
