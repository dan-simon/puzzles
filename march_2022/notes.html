    <h2>Enigπ Notes</h2>
    <p>Firstly, this page is not a puzzle. Additionally, looking at source code will generally spoil puzzles. You can solve all puzzles without looking at source code, though in some cases downloading images may be helpful (and it's safe spoiler-wise).</p>
    <p>This is a small low-quality puzzlehunt written for Pi Day and for Enigmarch (a few days after Pi Day). The puzzles here are relatively rushed. Also, this hunt uses partials (answers that are close to, but not, correct and might be what you'd try first) way over-aggressively.</p>
    <p>Feel free to skip around in the hunt! Day 14 is a metapuzzle, so you might not want to open it early. Difficulty very vaguely increases from one day to the next but that's nowhere near exact.</p>
    <p>I had some trouble getting Jack Lance's P.I. Hunt 8 to run correctly, which led to me writing this hunt due to wanting puzzles but not being able to get them. The theme of this hunt is based on that, but the specific issue in the theme was not what I encountered, and I've heard that the issue I encountered has been fixed. I expect P.I. Hunt 8 is pretty great (though I haven't solved it yet).</p>
