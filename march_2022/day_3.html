    <h2>The Dark Knight (Day 3, "shadow")</h2>
    <span>Enter your answer here: <input id="answer-3" type="text"/><input type="submit" onclick="checkAnswer('3')" value="Check"/> <span id="check-answer-result-3"></span></span>

    <span>First, shade some cells based on the nonogram clues. Some cells are already shaded to help you. Then, make a loop (possibly crossing itself) through all the shaded cells (and only the shaded cells) such that adjacent cells in the loop are always a knight's move apart. The numbers in the corners of some cells give you their positions in the loop (from 1 to 28). The letters on cells are only for getting the final answer.</span>

    <span>This puzzle is at <a target="_blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yawj8ctw">this penpa link.</a> Answer checking requires both the nonogram and knight-move loop (you can make knight-move loops with "Line" mode's "Free" setting).</span>
