    <h2>January 2020 Puzzles</h2>
    <p class="flavortext">Ok, so it turns out that when I tried to post the puzzles, I instead accidentally deleted them. I'm still looking into how that happened. Fortunately, I have a backup. Unfortunately, I'm not sure where I put it. Fortunately, I have some reminders. Unfortunately, the reminders are in the form of puzzles. While I try to figure out how all the puzzles were deleted, maybe you can try to figure out where the backup is so that I can retrieve it.</p>

    <p>Here are some <a href="hints/index.html">hints</a>. The puzzles should all be solvable without hints, but the hints are there if you need them.</p>
    <p>Here are the <a href="solutions/index.html">solutions</a> if you really need them. I would encourage you to give the puzzles a serious try, use the provided hints, or even ask me for more helpful hints before looking at the solutions, but you can do what you want. To minimize accidental clicking on solution links, the puzzles don't have their own solution links on their own pages (the link here goes to a page with links to each individual solution).</p>
