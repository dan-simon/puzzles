    <h2>Errata</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>October 8, 2020: There was a typo and some confusion in the solution to Spot the Difference. The typo was fixed, and the confusing part was also fixed and further clarified.</li>
      <li>December 31, 2020: The solution to Night Sky stated that Night Sky's image has 256 dots. It actually has 215 dots. This does not impact the method of solving at all, except insofar as 256 is a hint towards color values and 215 is not, and insofar as people might try to find nonexistent significance in 215.</li>
      <li>December 31, 2020 (yes, also): There was an erroneous clue in Nothing Is Forever and another one in Another Angle. Both clues, and both puzzles without the clues, were solvable (from the given data it was possible to confidently get the answer) but flawed. Both clues have been changed. Additional notes have been added to the solutions.</li>
    </ul>
