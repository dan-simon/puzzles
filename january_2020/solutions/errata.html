    <h2>Errata</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>October 8, 2020: There was a typo and some confusion in the solution to Spot the Difference. The typo was fixed, and the confusing part was also fixed and further clarified.</li>
      <li>December 31, 2020: The solution to Night Sky stated that Night Sky's image has 256 dots. It actually has 215 dots. This does not impact the method of solving at all, except insofar as 256 is a hint towards color values and 215 is not, and insofar as people might try to find nonexistent significance in 215.</li>
