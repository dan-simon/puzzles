    <p>Top left of 8371: In When and Where, after 8371 steps the top left four spaces of the grid spell out zero. This can be determined by waiting almost seven hours for Grid 8371 to appear, by calling the function in the JavaScript that shows the next grid 8371 times, or by doing modular arithmetic as required in the solution to When and Where itself. This grid is shown below.</p>
    <p>Grid 8371:</p>
    <table class="grid">
      <tr>
        <td>Z</td>
        <td>E</td>
        <td>R</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>E</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>M</td>
        <td>F</td>
        <td>R</td>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>Y</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>D</td>
        <td>W</td>
        <td>R</td>
        <td>Q</td>
        <td>E</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>K</td>
        <td>M</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>D</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>U</td>
        <td>P</td>
        <td>Y</td>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>E</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Solvers might consider taking just the z, but the fact that all of zero is spelled out should be a strong reason not to do that.</p>
    <p>We get 0.</p>
