    <h2>Nothing Is Forever: Solution</h2>
    <a href="../nothing_is_forever.html">(back to puzzle)</a>
    <p>Each line is the wordplay part of a cryptic clue. Each of the answers is a mineral (sometimes a rock, sometimes a metal) with a letter missing. The minerals are sorted by hardness to aid in solving. The given answer lengths don't count the missing letter.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Police public relations (5) (cop + pr = copp(e)r)</li>
      <li>Disease initially only infects those exercising (7) (flu + initial letters of "only infects those exercising" = fluo(r)ite)</li>
      <li>Eighty-five percent identify Iowa within Senegal (7) (b + (id + ia) in sn = (o)bsidian)</li>
      <li>Young person around ape (5) (jr surrounding ape = ja(s)per)</li>
      <li>Torch beheaded confused British mother (7) (anagrammed (torch without first letter) + mum = chrom(i)um)</li>
      <li>A hundred run, turning over mud (7) (c + run + revesed mud = c(o)rundum)</li>
      <li>Ruined South Pacific statues, five hundred on each side (6) (anagrammed moai with d on each side = diamo(n)d)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Taking the missing letters in the given order, we get the answer.</p>
    <p>Answer: erosion</p>
    <p>Note: This puzzle was intended to be an easy (even compared to the other puzzles) wordplay puzzle. Hopefully the fact that the answers weren't words didn't confuse anyone too much.</p>
