    <p>First note of the anhemitonic audio file: In Leftovers, the only one of the audio files with an anhemitonic scale, or even satisfying the weaker condition of having no semitones between two consecutive notes, is leftovers_e.wav, which starts with E. leftovers_e.wav uses C, D, E, and G, which suggests that it uses the major pentatonic scale CDEGA, but we don't know for sure because it doesn't use A, but exactly which scale leftovers_e.wav uses doesn't matter anyway.</p>
    <p>For convenience, here is leftovers_e.wav:</p>
