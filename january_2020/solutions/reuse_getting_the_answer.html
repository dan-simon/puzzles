    <h2>Reuse: How to get the answer</h2>

    <p>The answers to these clues, put together in the order that the nine puzzles appear in the meta, gives us "minute division 60", or maybe "minute / 60". It should be clear that this is either a second or maybe an hour, and the provided enumeration, in telling us that the answer is six letters long, shows that it's a second. This answer fits well with "Just because something has been relevant for the first time doesn't mean it won't be relevant again." from the flavor text, and generally with the methodology of this puzzle.</p>
    <p>Answer: second</p>
