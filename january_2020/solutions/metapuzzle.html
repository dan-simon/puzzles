    <a href="../metapuzzle.html">(back to puzzle)</a>
    <p>A list of the puzzle answers is <a href="metapuzzle_answer_list.html">here</a> if you want to see them all.</p>
    <p>Each pair of consecutive answers (1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, 9 and 10) has exactly one common bigram (though it's usually not in the same position). Also, in each pair of answers, the alphabetically first answer is first, but this is only relevant insofar as it determines the order of each pair of answers, which would otherwise be arbitary. These common bigrams are os, up, ta, ec, and re. Reading the first letters and then the last letters gives us the meta answer.</p>
    <p>Answer: outer space</p>
