    <h2>Reuse: Solution</h2>
    <a href="../reuse.html">(back to puzzle)</a>
    <p>Each of the nine clues refers to some part of one of the other nine puzzles. They are given sorted alphabetically by clue, not by puzzle. To avoid accidental spoilers, these parts are linked below both by the clues in this puzzle they correspond to and by other puzzle (however, clicking on the link for a part will tell you both the clue and the puzzle it corresponds to).</p>

    <p>Some of these clues may help solvers solve some of the other puzzles, especially as they solve more puzzles and can start trying to determine which clue applies to which other puzzle.</p>

    <p>Answer: second</p>
    <p>Note: In Nothing Is Forever, Every Word Is Three Letters, Leftovers, Compound Words, and When and Where, there were no changes to the puzzle needed to get the clue. (In all of the above but When and Where, it is not that surprising that this was possible.) In Spot the Difference and Night Sky, the clue was explicitly inserted into the puzzle in the puzzle design process. In What Does It Mean? and Another Angle, the clue was kept in mind during puzzle creation but didn't constrain the puzzle that much.</p>
