    <h2>Hints</h2>
    <p>This page has hints; the puzzles are <a href="../index.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The hints are hidden via a black background; select them or click and hold on them to view them (clicking and holding has only been tested on a computer but may also work on a phone).</p>
    <p>Make sure to view the hints in order unless it's specifically stated that you can do otherwise. Later hints often spoil the information in earlier hints.</p>
    <p>An "aha moment", for the purpose of these hints, is a part of a puzzle that isn't clear (where there's no fixed standard for "clear"). Hints that spoil an aha moment will say so.</p>
    <p>There are many hints for each puzzle because I think many small hints is better than a few large hints when viewing a hint doesn't have a large cost.</p>

  <p>Here are the <a href="../solutions/index.html">solutions</a> if you really need them. However, the hints are rather thorough and should help you in most situations (the main exception being data gathering).</p>
