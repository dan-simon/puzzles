    <ul>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">What do you notice in the grid of numbers?</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Do you notice anything in the bottom row?</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">This puzzle is a "number search".</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">You're searching for well-known sequences of numbers.</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">What numbers can you see in the grid that are part of well-known sequences of numbers?</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">For the numbers given by the above hint, can you find a sequence in the grid they're in?</span></li>
      <li>This hint very strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Can you almost find a sequence in the grid they're in?</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away an aha moment. <span class="hint">The grid contains six almost-sequences, that is, sequences with one item changed (different), as clued by the title and flavortext.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">These sequences are each six numbers long.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">How might we order these sequences? (Ordering is slightly helpful but in the end not that important.)</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">These sequences each have a number changed in a different position.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Order the sequences in order of the changed number's position, which is also alphabetical order of the sequence name.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The next step is to get a number from each sequence.</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">No, the number you want from each sequence isn't simply the changed number (it's neither what it was changed from or what it was changed to).</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Compare the numbers in the sequences that were changed to what they were changed to.</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Note that the changes always increased the numbers.</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The title and flavortext can both be used again.</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away an aha moment. <span class="hint">Subtract the original changed number from the number it was changed to. This gives you six numbers.</span></li>
      <li>This hint suggests a method of doing research and can be skipped. <span class="hint">Searching these six numbers should be helpful if you don't recognize them.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The answer has four letters, as clued by the four blanks. That should resolve any ambiguity there might be about what the answer is.</span></li>
    </ul>
