    <h2>Leftovers: Hints</h2>
    <a href="../leftovers.html">(back to puzzle)</a>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="hint">You have some audio files. So transcribe them in some way.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The first note of each file is the letter on the same line.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Where's the file starting with B?</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The audio files are all the same length.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Not all the audio files have the same number of notes.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The audio files all use the same tempo.</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The audio files all use the same scale (C major, or A minor).</span></li>
      <li>This hint somewhat strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">If you played all the audio files at the same time, what would happen?</span></li>
      <li>This hint somewhat strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">If you played all the audio files at the same time, what notes would be being played?</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">If you played all the audio files at the same time, no two files are playing the same note at the same time.</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Why is the puzzle titled "Leftovers"?</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The flavortext says "I've tried a lot of completely different things, but it seems like all of them were completely wrong". What does that suggest?</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away an aha moment. <span class="hint">Consider what the audio file with the notes that aren't being used at each time would be.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Remember, in the given files, notes aren't immediately repeated and instead are played for longer, so do the same in imagining (or creating) the new file.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Once you've figured out what the new audio file would be, you can try creating it, or just singing it.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The new audio file should be recognizable as part of a song.</span></li>
      <li>This hint suggests a method of doing research and can be skipped. <span class="hint">Searching the sequence of notes in the new audio file might help if you can't recognize the song.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The answer has eight letters, as clued by the eight blanks. That should resolve any minor ambiguity there might be about what is and isn't part of the answer.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The answer checker throws away characters that aren't from a to z (capital or lowercase), so use the form of the answer without any such character.</span></li>
    </ul>
