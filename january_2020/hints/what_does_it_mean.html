    <h2>What Does It Mean?: Hints</h2>
    <a href="../what_does_it_mean.html">(back to puzzle)</a>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="hint">As you may have already found with the answer checker, the answer isn't simply "hexoctahedron", as it might seem from the flavortext.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The text of the puzzle (apart from the flavortext) is a series of lines, all with a certain property, which will be called acceptability thoughout the rest of these hints.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Any acceptable line, or set of lines, could be added to the puzzle, and this would almost certainly, if anything, make it easier to solve.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The main important thing to do in solving this puzzle is figure out what the property all the given lines has is, and how to determine if a line has it.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The separation between sets of lines is not necessary to solve the puzzle, and serves to break the lines into smaller subsets within each of which all the lines are similar in some way.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Reading the lines in order is a good place to start.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Look at the first six lines. What do they all have in common?</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Do you think edw would be acceptable?</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">edw would not be acceptable.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Looking at the next three sets of six lines, we have etdww at the start of the second set (counting the first six lines we've already looked at as the first set) and ewtdw at the start of the fourth set.</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Recall our guess for acceptability of e followed by two single letters. What does this suggest about tdw as w, since etdww and ewtdw are both acceptable?</span></li>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Is there anything similar to the above that can be said about, for example, twv and b? By the way, the next hint gives additional information about e, so if you don't want that additional information yet don't read any more hints.</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment and gives away a small part of that aha moment. <span class="hint">e can be thought of equivalence, in some sense, of the two things following it.</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The above tells us that, using ~ for equivalence, tdw ~ w, tww ~ c, twc ~ v, twv ~ b, tbw ~ u, and apparently tuw ~ xcv.</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Using the third set of six lines, we see that all these equivalences are also true if the two characters following t are swapped (so, for example, twd ~ w).</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The fifth set of lines, this one with only three lines, tells us that tdc ~ c, tcc ~ b, and tbc ~ xcv.</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">You can keep proceeding in this way to get some more equivalences involving t.</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Is there any meaning t could have, and that d, w, c, v, b, and u could have, that would explain these equivalences?</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Is there anything looking sort of like t (lowercase t) that might be relevant?</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away most of an aha moment. The rest is given away in following hints. <span class="hint">t is + (except it takes its two operands after it, rather than one before and one after). The next hint gives away what d, w, c, v, b, and u are.</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away some of the rest of the above aha moment. <span class="hint">d, w, c, v, b, and u are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, in that order. The next hint gives away exactly what e is, if it isn't already clear.</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away some of the rest of the above aha moment. <span class="hint">e is =. From now on hints will be more gentle guides to figuring out what is what, rather than saying it directly. There are some exception which will be clearly stated beforehand so you don't accidentally spoil yourself.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">s and x should now not be that hard to figure out.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">For the two first sets of lines all beginning with f, look at what's not included.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">For example, there's no line that's fedd, and indeed fedd is unacceptable.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Now that you know what f is, l and g shouldn't be that hard.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">There are some lines that use e twice, and some that use f in a non-initial position. Knowing the conventions for false and true in programming might help here; these conventions are stated in the next two hints.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">False is generally zero, true is generally one. (In some programming languages this is literally true, in some it's only mostly true.)</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">If a number is considered true or false, any number other than zero is generally considered true; zero is generally considered false.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Determining what z, q, r, j, and k are is now not that hard.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">h, o, a, and n are a little confusing. The next few hints help somewhat with those.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">a can only occur directly before h.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">h arguably has a different meaning when directly preceded by a.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">a can only occur directly after t, x, j, and k.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">t, x, j, and k have somewhat different meanings when directly followed by a.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">o must be following (not necessarily directly following) h.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">n must be following (not necessarily directly following) two occurences of h (not necessarily consecutive). The next hints explain exactly what h, o, a, and n do (in that order). There are two hints devoted to a.</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away some of the rest of the above (now far above) aha moment. <span class="hint">h is usually (that is, not directly after a) "having the property that".</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away some of the rest of the above aha moment. <span class="hint">o is a reference to the number potentially having the property. So, for example, heovv means that 3 (v, the second one) has the property described by heov, that is, the property (h) of equality (e) between it (o) and 3 (v, the first one). In other words, heovv means that 3 has the property of being equal to 3.</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away some of the rest of the above aha moment. <span class="hint">a is "the list of all positive integers" (not including 0), so ah is "the list of all positive integers having the property that". The next hint is about the meaning of t, x, j, and k before a.</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away some of the rest of the above aha moment. <span class="hint">t, x, j, and k before a combine all the numbers in the list. So, for example, t preceding a list is that list's sum.</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away some of the rest of the above aha moment. <span class="hint">n is used when one property definition (via h) is nested in another to refer to the number in the inner property definition. In this case, o refers to the number in the outer property definition. So, for example, hetahlnovv means that 3 (second v) has the property (first h) that the sum of all the positive integers (tah) with the property that they (n) are less than (l) it (o) is (e) 3 (first v). Stated without the parenthesized letters, this says that 3 has the property that the sum of all the positive integers less than it is 3, which is true. Compare to etahlovv, which says more simply that the sum of all the positive integers less than 3 is 3.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Now that we know what all the letters mean, what can we do?</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment (a new one; the above one is done). <span class="hint">That "hexoctahedron" in the flavortext isn't completely irrelevant.</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The answer is hexoctahedron, in a sense.</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away an aha moment. <span class="hint">The above method of interpreting letters lets hexoctahedron have a meaning that's a property of numbers.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The property of numbers that's the meaning of hexoctahedron is well-known.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">In fact, it has a name.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">If you're having trouble figuring out what the property is, trying some numbers might help.</span></li>
      <li>This hint suggests a method of doing research, and since it's the last hint, asking whether it can be skipped is meaningless. <span class="hint">After finding some numbers with the property (and some without, so you can eliminate overly-broad guesses for the property), if you still don't know the property's name, searching those numbers might help. If you have only one or two such numbers, adding other relevant keywords or looking on some reference page for properties of numbers might be useful.</span></li>
