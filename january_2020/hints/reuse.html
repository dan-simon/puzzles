    <h2>Reuse: Hints</h2>
    <a href="../reuse.html">(back to puzzle)</a>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="hint">This puzzle has a hodgepodge of apparently random stuff. It's difficult to see how it could make up a puzzle.</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">There's a reference to an audio file, but no actual audio file. Where might that audio file be?</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">What is "Before the r extracted from the last word" talking about? One might think this puzzle is self-referential, but actually it isn't, so what's the relevant extraction?</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away an aha moment. <span class="hint">Each of the nine clues refers to some part of one of the other nine puzzles.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The clues are given sorted alphabetically by clue. In particular, this means it is unclear which puzzle each clue is for.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Some hint structure stuff: the next hint gives general information about the structure of the clue answers and can be skipped. The hints after that are mostly numbered 1-9. The number on a hint indicates which of the clues it is for, from top to bottom. Each of the sets of numbered hints can be read independently of the other eight, and none of the sets are needed for the final few hints that aren't numbered. The first hint with each number gives away which puzzle that clue is for. The remaining hints for a clue will generally assume you know the solution of the associated puzzle (not just the answer). Hints that can be read on their own and that will not spoil the associated puzzle (though they generally hint at which one it is) are marked with x; even if you know the solution of the associated puzzle, these x hints should not be skipped.</span></li>
      <li>This hint can be skipped. <span class="hint">The answer to each clue is usually a letter and can always be thought of as a single character.</span></li>
      <li>1 <span class="hint">"Alligator pear (7)" is associated with Every Word Is Three Letters.</span></li>
      <li>1x <span class="hint">Search will reveal that an alligator pear is an avocado.</span></li>
      <li>1 <span class="hint">Using the methodology of Every Word Is Three Letters, avocado is equivalent to a single letter.</span></li>
      <li>2 <span class="hint">"Before the r extracted from the last word" is associated with Compound Words.</span></li>
      <li>2 <span class="hint">As part of Compound Words, solvers found five words and then extracted two letters from each.</span></li>
      <li>2 <span class="hint">Look in the last of those five words, before the r you extracted from it. That r is the second letter in the word so there's only one letter before it.</span></li>
      <li>3 <span class="hint">"Every other column of 8x8" is associated with Spot the Difference.</span></li>
      <li>3x <span class="hint">100 - 36 = 64</span></li>
      <li>3 <span class="hint">There were six sequences of six numbers found in the 10x10 grid in Spot the Difference.</span></li>
      <li>3 <span class="hint">Removing the six sequences of six numbers from the 10x10 grid, we can fill an 8x8 grid.</span></li>
      <li>3 <span class="hint">When putting the remaining numbers in the 10x10 grid, one should read them left-to-right and top-to-bottom, as usual.</span></li>
      <li>3 <span class="hint">Do you notice anything about any of the columns in this 8x8 grid?</span></li>
      <li>3 <span class="hint">The second column starts with 20, 8, 5. What could that mean?</span></li>
      <li>3 <span class="hint">Try interpreting the numbers via A=1, Z=26 encoding.</span></li>
      <li>3 <span class="hint">Numbers higher than 26 are spaces.</span></li>
      <li>3 <span class="hint">Of course, don't consider all the columns. Only consider every other one, starting with the second.</span></li>
      <li>4 <span class="hint">"First note of the anhemitonic audio file<" is associated with Leftovers.</span></li>
      <li>4x <span class="hint">"anhemitonic" means "not having semitones", or perhaps "using a scale without semitones".</span></li>
      <li>4 <span class="hint">Only one of the audio files has no semitones, and it also uses a scale with no semitones. Which one, and what's its first note?</span></li>
      <li>5 <span class="hint">"In the last three but not in the first four" is associated with Nothing Is Forever.</span></li>
      <li>5x <span class="hint">The mentions of "last three" and "first four" indicate that there might be seven total of whatever the things being mentioned are.</span></li>
      <li>5x <span class="hint">Which puzzle has seven of something?</span></li>
      <li>5x <span class="hint">No, the associated puzzle isn't Leftovers.</span></li>
      <li>5 <span class="hint">In Nothing is Forever, there are seven clues and seven answers.</span></li>
      <li>5 <span class="hint">There's nothing chemically in the last three answers but not the first four.</span></li>
      <li>5 <span class="hint">There's no letter in the last three clues but not the first four.</span></li>
      <li>5 <span class="hint">Whether you consider the dropped letters to be part of the answers or not, there's a unique letter in the last three answers but not in the first four.</span></li>
      <li>6 <span class="hint">"Red 246" is associated with Night Sky.</span></li>
      <li>6x <span class="hint">246 can be the red value of a color.</span></li>
      <li>6x <span class="hint">In fact, it's almost the maximum red value; white, with the maximum red value, has red value 255.</span></li>
      <li>6 <span class="hint">Night Sky has an image. What could you do with an image and a red value?</span></li>
      <li>6 <span class="hint">Look at the pixels with red value 246.</span></li>
      <li>7 <span class="hint">"The number of occurrences of e, out of 39" is associated with Another Angle.</span></li>
      <li>7x <span class="hint">39 = 3 Ã— 13</span></li>
      <li>7x <span class="hint">What puzzle has something relating to 13?</span></li>
      <li>7 <span class="hint">In Another Angle, there are three clues, each of length 13.</span></li>
      <li>7 <span class="hint">These clues have 39 total letters.</span></li>
      <li>7 <span class="hint">How many occurences of e are there in these clues?</span></li>
      <li>8 <span class="hint">"The operation that z represents" is associated with What Does It Mean?</span></li>
      <li>8 <span class="hint">In What Does It Mean?, each letter represents a number or operation.</span></li>
      <li>8 <span class="hint">The answer for this clue is just the operation that z represents in What Does It Mean?</span></li>
      <li>9 <span class="hint">"Top left of 8371" is associated with When and Where.</span></li>
      <li>9 <span class="hint">When and Where has a grid of letters that changes every 5 seconds, with an associated number which starts at 0 and increases by 1 for each new grid.</span></li>
      <li>9 <span class="hint">This puzzle involves grid 8371.</span></li>
      <li>9 <span class="hint">You can get grid 8371 by multiple methods, as described in the next hint.</span></li>
      <li>9, This hint can be skipped. <span class="hint">Some of these methods are waiting for about half a day, using the console to "fast-forward", and calculating what the grid would be.</span></li>
      <li>9 <span class="hint">Once you've found grid 8371, look at the top left.</span></li>
      <li>9 <span class="hint">Don't take just the single letter in the top left. There's a (slightly) longer message in grid 8371 that you should consider.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Once you've gotten most, or even many, of the clue answers, you have to somehow get an answer from them.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Put the clue answers together.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Putting the clue answers together in the given order makes very little sense. Is there another natural order?</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Put the clue answers together in the order that the associated puzzles are in.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The result of putting the clue answers together is a clue for the answer.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The answer has six letters, as clued by the six blanks, which should resolve a potential minor ambiguity.</span></li>
    </ul>
