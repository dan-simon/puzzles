    <h2>Compound Words: Hints</h2>
    <a href="../compound_words.html">(back to puzzle)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>This hint slightly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">What are the ten words/pairs of words/triples of words referring to?</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">They're all multiple definitions of something.</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">The flavor text mentions Greek, but after saying it's all Greek, it says "at least mostly". How might that be relevant?</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away an aha moment. <span class="hint">The ten words/pairs of words/triples of words are all multiple meanings of a Greek or Latin root.</span></li>
      <li>This hint suggests a method of doing research and can be skipped. <span class="hint">Searching "x root greek" or "x root latin", with x replaced by the meaning or meanings of the root in question, can help suggest possible roots.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">How many lines of blanks are there below the ten meanings of roots?</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Why is the puzzle titled "Compound Words"?</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">You can pair up the ten roots with meanings given above to make five English words. This also helps resolve some of the ambiguity in the choice of the roots.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">These five words can be put into the lines of blanks.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Which letters fall on the boxes?</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Is there a way to make some words from the letters in the boxes?</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Reading the first boxed letter in each word will give a word.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Reading the second boxed letter in each word will also give a word.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Is there a way to repeat the mechanism of the puzzle with the two words you got from reading the letters in the boxes?</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">What are roots with those meanings, and what's an English word with both those roots?</span></li>
    </ul>
