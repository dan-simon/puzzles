    <h2>Another Angle: Hints</h2>
    <a href="../another_angle.html">(back to puzzle)</a>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="hint">The left clues are regular clues. The right clues are the wordplay parts of cryptic clues.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The answer to each clue is a word.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The answers to the clues should be put in the grid.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">There's only one intended way to put the answers to the clues in the grid.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Each type of clue (regular and wordplay) is given in order of the answer lengths, and the answer lengths within each type are 1 to 12 once each.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Put an answer to a regular clue to the left of the black space in each row (unless the black space is on the furthest-left cell), and an answer to a wordplay clue to the right (unless the black space is on the furthest-right cell).</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">Why is the puzzle titled "Another Angle"?</span></li>
      <li>This hint clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">What could you put at another angle? And how could you get one letter from each row of the given grid?</span></li>
      <li>This hint strongly clues an aha moment. <span class="hint">No, you don't put the filled grid at another angle.</span></li>
      <li>This hint gives away an aha moment. <span class="hint">Overlay the unfilled grid at another angle on the puzzle, and look at the letters on the black spaces.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">What angle do you want to rotate the unfilled grid by to get a clue?</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Each of 90 degrees clockwise, 90 degrees counterclockwise, and 180 degrees gives a different clue.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">No word answers all three clues (as far as I know).</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">Is there any way to choose the answers to the clues so that they have something in common?</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The flavortext says "the answer to the puzzle is missing".</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">The answers to the clues are three of four items in a common set.</span></li>
      <li><span class="hint">What's the fourth item in that set (the missing one)?</span></li>
    </ul>
